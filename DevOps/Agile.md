# Agile 
- Mindset for approaching software Development
- **You should be agile or flexible in designing and building software**
  - You are encouraged to go back and edit/change your designs if they begin to fail
  - If you are spending too much time fixing it scrap and start off
  - Don't commit yourself to a specific thing 
- **Software is NOT like other types of engineering**
  - Your resources are very malleable and changeable
  - A bride engineer cannot just deice to try out a different support column 100 meters somewhere
    - Dangerous
    - Time-Consuming
    - EXPENSIVE

## Agile Tenants
- Guidelines not rules
  - Individuals and interaction over processes
  - Working software over documentation
  - Customer Collaboration over contracts
  - Respond to change vs following plan

### Agile mindset for p1
- Individuals and interaction over processes
  - Work with your teamgates
  - If you run into bugs get Patrick or me
- Working software over documention
  - Functionality is king
  - Create complaints working front-end to backend is much more valueable then the design and ERD
- Customer Collaboratio over contracts
  - Ask patrick or myself for clarification on a user story
- Respons to change vs following a plan
  - As you work by feature you will disover things that work well and things won't
  - Refactor your code as necessary

### Waterfall
- Everything is 100% planned out from the start
  - You stick the plan never change
- Was not designed for software
  - A production model for products from the 50s
- Waterfall is not inherently bad for software
  - Sometimes application with strict requirements
