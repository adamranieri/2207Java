# Azure
- It is Microsoft's cloud computing service
- 2nd place behind AWS
- I think a large part of it's appeal is to go ALL IN on Microsoft
  - Email with outlook
  - office 365
  - **Azure**
  - .NET for your programming

## Cloud Computing
- In the past if you wanted to run a website you had to buy physical computers and operate them
  - You had buy a building and ethernet cables
  - You had to pay the electric bill
  - You had to pay people to monitor them
- For VERY large companies this was doable if tedious and expensive
  - Small startups cannot afford to lease buildings
- Cloud Computing is **renting** virtual IT resources over the internet VS having to physically buy them and operate them
  - Quickly get rid of anything we are not using 
  - Only charged for what you use
- Cloud computing is cheaper usually
  - The lower barrier of entry made it feasisble for small companies to have great IT

- Examples of IT resources
  - Virtual Machines that we can put web servers on
  - Load Balancers (they manage network traffic to support thousands to millions of users)
  - Datatbases for storing information
  - etc...

## Terms to know

    - Everything we do in azure must put in a resource group at some point
