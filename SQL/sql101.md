# Database
- A program that saves information
  - The information is saved in a a **persistent format**
  - If you turn off the power the data will persist, it will not be destroyed
  - persistent data storage types
    - hard disk
    - Magnetic tape
    - Cuneiform tablet
- Tons of different paradigms of databases
  - NoSQL
    - Data is stored in semi-structured non strict ways
      - Documents (MongoDB)
  - SQL
    - **Relational Database**
    - Data is stored in tables that reference or relate to one another 

# SQL
- Structured Query Language
  - Programming language for **Relational Databases**
  - DSL (Domain Specific Language)
    - Language designed to do one thing specifically
    - CSS is designed for styling web pages
- Dialects
  - postgresql
  - MySQL
  - Microsfot SQL Server
  - Oracle (yuck)
- Most versions of SQL are not case sensitive for commands
  - the names of tables are case sensitive
  - but there is no standard
  - ***KEEP YOUR CODE CONSISTENT***
  - Tables should be named in the singular
    - The table name reflects what each individual record is
- **Table**
  - **Rows/records**
    - Horizontal rows
  - **Columns/attributes**
    - Vertical columns


|associate_id| first_name | last_name | state |
|------------|------------|-----------|-------|
|101|Bill|Billson|New York|
|202|James|Sunderland| Maine|
|303|Hank|Hill|New York|


## Sub Languages of SQL
- **DDL**
  - Commands for creating the **schema**
    - CREATE, DROP, ALTER
    - Schema is a technical term for the structure of your database
      - The tables and columns within those tables
- **DML**
  - Commands for editing the data within the table
    - DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT

## Constraints
- Restrictions we can add to columns on a table
  - **Primary key**
    - combination of two keys Unique and not null
    - Put on a column that serves as a unique identifier for a record.
    - Typically put on a column that represents an ID
  - **Unique**
    - All values withing the column must be unique
  - **NOT NULL**
    - Values cannot null within this column
  - **Check**
    - A conditional that must be met for the column
  - **DEFAULT** 
    - A default value if none is provided
- **Serial**
  - Not really a constraint
  - Does allow you to auto increment
  - Great for IDs

## Normalization
- This is the process of removing redundancy from a database/table
  - This not always a good thing
  - really normalized data can be difficult to work with

### 1NF
- A table has a primary key
  - Each record is uniquely identifiable
- There are no composite columns
  - The data in the column is atomic
  - cannot be broken down into more meaningful colums

denormalized data
|name|salary|
|----|------|
|Lebron James| 26000000|
|Steph Curry| 21000000|
|Steph Curry| 21000000|

normalized data
|id|first_name|last_name|salary|
|--|----------|---------|------|
|101|lebron|James|26000000|
|102|steph| curry| 21000000|
|103|steph| curry| 21000000|


### 2NF 
- A table that follows 1st normalized form
- No column is a **functional dependency**
  - A column cannot be calculated using values in another column

Not in second normalized form
|player_id| shots_attempted | shots_made | shooting_percentage|
|---------|-----------------|------------|--------------------|
|101| 200| 120| 60|
