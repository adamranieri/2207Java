# Java 101
- Java was designed with **Scalability** as the top priority
  - Java is the language for enterprise development
    - Teams of developers working on the same project
    - Applications with 10,000's of lines of code

## Features 
- Strongly Typed
  - There is no *implicit* type coercion in Java
- Statically Typed
  - All variables will have their data typed defined.
  - All methods have a return type
- High Level Language
  - No pointers
  - No direct memory management
    - **Memory errors** were a HUGE proporotion of bugs in enterprise applications
- Compiled
  - You write human readable .java files. Your source code.
  - A Java Compiler will can .java files and create .class versions of those files.
    - .class files contain Java Byte Code which is for use by the machine. Not really human readable
  - Compilation does a lot of things for you
    - It will verify code intergrity
      - There are no missing methods being called
      - That any checked exceptions are being handled
    - It will make optimatization for you   
      - Your exact syntax does not matter for optimization purposes
- OOP
  - **Object Oriented Programming**
  - A paradigm of programming
    - A general way to structure and organize your code
    - An approach to coding solutions
  - 99% OOP
    - Class and Object based coding
  - OOP leads to scalable design patterns
    - Factory
    - Singleton 
    - getters and setters
- WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere)
  - Any Java program can run the same on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine
    - *2 billion devices run Java*
    - Android is built on top of Java
  - Huge feature when Java came out in 1995
- Java has an enourmous ecocsystem
  - Almost anything you write there is a Java library out there that does it
