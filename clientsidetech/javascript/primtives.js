// JS has primtive values. A semantic term. Primitives are actually objects

//
let s = "Adam";// string
let num = 100.9; // number there is no int,float, double 
let b = true; // boolean 
let n = null; // no value. is a value that must be explicitly assigned
let u = undefined; // never had a value. You should never directly assign a value as undefined. Undefined is the default value of everything in JS

let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
